# Console log for devices
Ability to see console log via hand gadgets like smartphones and tabs.

Just include the script "only-for-develope" in your ```<head>``` tag and that's it! 
By default You will see first console.log "init done", that means everything works fine ;)

## Usage

1. Insert script in ```<head>```
```
<script src="only-for-develope.js"></script>
```
2. Console.log something in your (main?).js file
```
console.log('Hello world!');
console.error('Oops...');
```
