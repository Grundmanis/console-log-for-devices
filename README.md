# Console log for devices
Ability to see console log via hand gadgets as smartphones and tabs.

Just include the script "only-for-develope" in your <head> tag and that's it! 
By default first console.log will be "init done", that means everything works fine ;)

# Usage
console.log('Hello world!');

console.error('Oops...');
